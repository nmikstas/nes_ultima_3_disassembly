;Banks 00, 01 and 06 contain the overhead maps. There are a total of 15 maps. The maps are uncompressed and are all the same size (64 X 64 blocks).
;The overworld map and Ambrosia have their own unique map blocks. All the remaining maps use the same map blocks. Each data byte contains map information
;for 2 blocks. The data for each map row of 64 blocks is contained within 32 bytes.
